Rb Changelog
============

Version 1.4
-----------

- Fixed cluster for host defaults support.
- Changed poller to handle close explicitly.  This should prevent
  bad loops in when the socket closes while writing.
- Added support for execute_commands.

Version 1.3.1
-------------

(released on Oct 13th 2015)

- Fixed an illogical constructor for the local client.
- Fixed a problem with clearing out pending batches.
- Hosts are now validated to not have holes in the two shipped routers
  which both depend on a gapless setup.
- Connection errors now try to print out the original IO error's infos.

Version 1.3
-----------

(released on Oct 7th 2015)

- Quickly fixed `target_key`'s behavior to make sense so that the
  result on the promise is the value instead of a dictionary of a
  single host.

Version 1.2
-----------

(released on Oct 7th 2015)

- Added `target_key` to the fanout client to simplify targeting of hosts.

Version 1.1.2
-------------

(released on Sep 28th 2015)

- Fixed command buffers for disabled max concurrency.
- Fixed map manager timeouts.

Version 1.1.1
-------------

(released on Sep 15th 2015)

- Made rb work with older versions of pyredis.

Version 1.1
-----------

(released on Sep 9th 2015)

- Added internal support for async writes which improves performance
  and parallelism with large command batches where the command is
  larger than the kernel buffer size.

Version 1.0
-----------

(released on Sep 4th 2015)

- Added support for automatic batching of GET and SET to MGET and MSET.
- Added emulated `mget` and `mset` commands to promise based clients.
